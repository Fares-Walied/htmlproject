        <h1><u>What is Artificial Intelligence? And Why it is important</u></h1>
        <h3>Some definitions of AI   The exciting new effort to make computers think machines with minds, in the full literal sense. Hoagland, 1981. The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models.Charniak and McDermott, 1985. A field of study that seeks to explain and emulate intelligent behavior in terms of computational processes. Schalkoff, 1990. The study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better. Rich & Knight, 1991<br></br>.
            AI automates repetitive learning and discovery through data. But AI is different from hardware-driven, robotic automation. Instead of automating manual tasks, AI performs frequent, high-volume, computerized tasks reliably and without fatigue. For this type of automation, human inquiry is still essential to set up the system and ask the right questions. <br></br>
            AI adds intelligence to existing products. In most cases, AI will not be sold as an individual application. Rather, products you already use will be improved with AI capabilities, much like Siri was added as a feature to a new generation of Apple products. Automation, conversational platforms, bots and smart machines can be combined with large amounts of data to improve many technologies at home and in the workplace, from security intelligence to investment analysis. <br></br>
            AI adapts through progressive learning algorithms to let the data do the programming. AI finds structure and regularities in data so that the algorithm acquires a skill: The algorithm becomes a classifier or a predictor. So, just as the algorithm can teach itself how to play chess, it can teach itself what product to recommend next online. And the models adapt when given new data. Back propagation is an AI technique that allows the model to adjust, through training and added data, when the first answer is not quite right. <br></br>
            AI analyzes more and deeper data using neural networks that have many hidden layers. Building a fraud detection system with five hidden layers was almost impossible a few years ago. All that has changed with incredible computer power and big data. You need lots of data to train deep learning models because they learn directly from the data. The more data you can feed them, the more accurate they become.
